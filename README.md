# Dont Die
## 2023 UTD Fall

### I have created a videogame where you dodge incoming comets in space with the ability to shoot back.

### Lengthier Explanation:
###  The starting foundation of the game guided how I created features like shooting, lives, and many others. 
### The code to shoot had given me the hardest time though because of how the game loop and draw function interacted 
### with each other and if you look closely enough at either the video or if you try out the game, you'll see that the 
### old laser shots will be visible for a flash. This I had spent a lot of time trying to fix, but I ended up creating 
### the half fix that shows the old lasers for a flash as opposed to the original issue of the lasers not going away.
### Although that fix wasn't 100%, I still feel good about it because this made me realize that I could make a half
### fix and move on. Nonetheless, I still would say its my biggest bug.

### Furthermore, I wanted to lean into the simple art style of 8-bit and make everything pixel art, and I used art from
### a creator I mentioned in the credits.txt file for the background. Another point of credit goes to the background
### music also credited in the txt file. Without these, my game wouldn't have the same feeling of a retro space shooter 
### that I was going for. 

### Finally, I want to point out a feature of my game that allows it to be replayable and continuously enjoyable. As I 
### started this project I was constantly thinking of and inspired by the dinosaur game that Chrome shows you if you have
### no internet connection. That game is so replayable because of its high score function. I made it a goal of mine to 
### make sure this feature would make it to my game. It's the high score feature that will have me playing this game
### for the future to come. If I decide to continue working on the enjoyability and playability of this game, I will 
### post an update here. Hopefully, you like it, thanks for taking the time to read this message!
