## Description
I will create a media encoder. This will take an image sequence (of rendered images) all ending with a number iteration in the thousands(0000) and will create a video based on the settings you choose.

## Features
- Converting the imagetype(if needed)
	- exr to jpg converter(this is because I have learned that exr is one of the best options to render out animations, but  
- Main function(Creating a video out of the image sequences)
	- Not exactly sure how this will be accomplished, but it will be using (0000 - 1000) because thats how maya numbers rendered images
- Choosing fps for the video
	- This will need to be learned/researcged

## Challenges
- Research documentation on converting images for exr
- researching how to create the video using already existing files
- research how to use the function glob to change the fps of an image sequence

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Best outcome is having an mp4 video using the input of an image sequence and chosen fps, and saving it to the disk under a given name

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The bare minimum is creating a video out of a given image sequence

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Bulk if not all research completed(this will guide my milestones better once completed)
  2. Creating the bare minimum of the main function

- Week 2
  1. Adding fps chooser feature
  2. adding converter(if not needed for bare minimum main function)(if needed then that will be first)

- Week N (Final)
  1. finishing up previous week milestones(flexibility gap)
  2. making the use of the code a good experience(creating input dialgue and stuff)
